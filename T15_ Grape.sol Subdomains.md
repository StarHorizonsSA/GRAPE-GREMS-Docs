### <span id="_w313v7yyc322"></span> **1. Purpose**

The **Grape.sol Subdomain** tab is a simple registry of GRAPE DAO community members who claimed a **grape.sol** subdomain. It ties each subdomain request to a **Discord name** and **wallet address** so the DAO has a clear reference for:

- Confirming which wallet a subdomain was associated with at the time of request  
    

- Reducing duplicate or conflicting subdomain claims  
    

- Providing a historical audit trail for future DAO programs involving names/subdomains  
    
    

**Note:** This tab is an informational registry. It does not calculate rewards and does not feed into emissions or recurring payments.

### <span id="_tnfr77z2xcn6"></span> **2. Tab Structure**

The tab contains three columns:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| **Column** | **Field** | **Meaning** |
| A | Discord Name | The member’s Discord handle as recorded at the time of request |
| B | Wallets | The wallet address provided by the member |
| C | Subdomains | The requested **grape.sol** subdomain (if assigned/recorded) |

### <span id="_2xt8trw8yaow"></span> **3. Data Entry Method**

Entries are recorded **manually** based on member submissions in the dedicated Discord channel (example: **\#grape.sol-subdomain**). Typical workflow:

1.  Member posts their desired subdomain name + wallet address in the channel  
      

2.  An operator copies the Discord name, wallet, and requested subdomain into this tab  
      

3.  The tab serves as the canonical “who requested what” log for that campaign window

### <span id="_x2lf3liu5nsw"></span> **4. Usage and Controls**

#### <span id="_fwul6w701pwl"></span> **4.1 Primary Uses**

- **Ownership reference:** quickly check which wallet was linked to a given subdomain request  
    

- **Duplication control:** detect repeated subdomain requests or conflicting names  
    

- **DAO memory:** retain a long-term record of subdomain assignments.  
    
    

#### <span id="_va4t1ngyfhig"></span> **4.2 Controls / Best Practices**

- Treat the wallet address as the primary identifier for resolving duplicates (Discord names can change).  
    

- Keep entries consistent (one row per member/wallet unless the DAO explicitly supports multiple subdomains per wallet).  
    

- If a request is edited or corrected, append a note or use a clear update convention so the history remains auditable.
